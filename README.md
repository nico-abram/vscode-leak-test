# Instruction

- Open this folder in vscode
- Open the integrated terminal
- Run overwrite_files once
- Open file1.log, file2.log and log.diff
- Run overwrite_files again in the integrated terminal
- Repeat previous step while monitoring memory usage
- Notice that even if you close the files memory stays the same
- ctrl+shift+p and reload window does bring the memory down (But it resets the terminal output, among other things)
